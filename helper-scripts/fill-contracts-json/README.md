## Fill missing fields in contracts.json

`contracts.json` generated by the c4coin-network-consensus scripts does not contain certain fields (`POA_ADDRESS`, `MOC`) that were added manually to `contracts.json` on production branches (e.g. [on core](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/core/contracts.json))

This script reads data from spec.json and moc address and adds missing fields to the `contracts.json`.

## Usage example:

1. if you can provide a path to txt file with MoC address:
```bash
MOC_ADDRESS_FILE_PATH=/home/moc/POA/moc CONTRACTS_JSON_PATH=/home/moc/POA/contracts.json SPEC_JSON_PATH=/home/moc/spec.json node script.js
```

2. if you can privde MoC address directly:
```bash
MOC_ADDRESS=0xdf9c9701e434c5c9f755ef8af18d6a4336550206 CONTRACTS_JSON_PATH=/home/moc/POA/contracts.json SPEC_JSON_PATH=/home/moc/spec.json node script.js

```

## Expected result:

`contract.json` file at `$CONTRACTS_JSON_PATH` will be updated. New version will contain fields `POA_ADDRESS` and `MOC`.
